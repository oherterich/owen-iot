## Thesis Show Entrance

For this project, we will be creating a visual that will be displayed near the entrance of the 2014 DT Thesis Show. This will be projected on a wall for everyone to see as they walk past. This piece will be a way to show the all of the different faces of DT in a sort of slideshow, albeit a visually interesting one. 

For now, the plan is to have people's faces made up of particle, which pulse and change over time to the next person's face. Originally, these particles were going to be interactive: as someone walked by, they would move and change. This part of the project is in contention, as we are not sure if this might distract from the actual show.

We are waiting for the Thesis Design Committee to decide on an aesthetic look for the show before we completely dedicate ourselves to a particular look or feel. Our project should be seamlessly integrated with the thesis show's visuals and theme.
