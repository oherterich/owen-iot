## Taptap

Taptap is a physical game that is played with your phone. The idea behind this project was to create something that bridged the gap between the digital and physical space: something that used the technology of the phone to encourage play in the physical world. We chose to  develop the game as a web app (as opposed to a native iOS or Android app) so that anyone can just go to a website and play the game without having to install any software. The idea was the create a way for people to play without having too much setup or extra hardware.

In this game, players will attach a phone to their back with a case and strap. When a round starts, players will try to tap each others' phones as many times as possible. Each tap will add to the victim's score. At the end of the round, the player with the lowest score is the winner.

This game was inspired by playground games from childhood: tag, capture the flag, and flag football. Physical play is the main focus: rather than focusing on the screen, the phone only exists as a tool to effectively count/capture what is happening in the game. A modern example of a physical game using hardware/software is [Johann Sebastian Joust](http://www.jsjoust.com/): in this game, participants carry Playstation Move controllers and try to knock each other over.

Ultimately, we hope that this game will be a fun way for people of all ages to use their phone as a bridge to a game in the physical world. Instead of looking down into a square of glass, players can use that technology as an augmentation to real world play.
